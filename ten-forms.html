        <h2>Introduction to the Ten Arabic Verb Forms</h2>
        <p>
          Arabic verbs are derived from roots and can take on different
          patterns, known as forms. There are ten primary forms, each with its
          own meaning and usage. Understanding these forms is crucial for
          mastering Arabic verb conjugation and expanding your vocabulary.
        </p>

        <h2>Form I (الفعل الثلاثي المجرد)</h2>
        <p>
          This is the base form of the verb, consisting of three root letters.
          It conveys the basic meaning of the root. This form is simple and
          straightforward, often used for basic actions or states.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>كتب (kataba)</strong> - He wrote. This is the simplest form
            of the verb, using the root letters ك-ت-ب (k-t-b), which convey the
            basic action of writing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>درس (darasa)</strong> - He studied. Again, this uses the
            root letters د-ر-س (d-r-s), which convey the basic action of
            studying.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form II (الفعل الثلاثي المزيد بحرف)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by doubling the second root letter. It often has
          a causative or intensive meaning. For example, it can mean to make
          someone do something or to do something intensely.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>درّس (darrasa)</strong> - He taught. Here, the root letters
            د-ر-س (d-r-s) are used again, but the second letter is doubled to
            create a causative meaning: to make someone study, i.e., to teach.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>كسّر (kassara)</strong> - He smashed/broke intensively. The
            root letters ك-س-ر (k-s-r) mean to break, and doubling the second
            letter intensifies the action.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form III (الفعل الثلاثي المزيد بحرف)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding an alif (ا) between the first and
          second root letters. It often has a connotation of doing something
          with someone, such as participating or fighting.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>شارك (sharika)</strong> - He participated. The root letters
            ش-ر-ك (sh-r-k) mean to share, and adding an alif conveys the meaning
            of participating or sharing with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>قاتل (qatala)</strong> - He fought. The root letters ق-ت-ل
            (q-t-l) mean to kill, and adding an alif changes the meaning to
            fighting, which implies a reciprocal action.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form IV (الفعل الرباعي المجرد)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding a hamza (أ) before the first root
          letter. It often has a causative meaning, similar to Form II, but
          typically used with different roots.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>أكتب (aktaba)</strong> - He made (someone) write. The root
            letters ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) mean to write, and adding a hamza changes the
            meaning to making someone write.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>أسمع (asma'a)</strong> - He made (someone) listen. The root
            letters س-م-ع (s-m-'a) mean to listen, and adding a hamza changes
            the meaning to making someone listen.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form V (الفعل الخماسي)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding a ta (ت) before the second root letter
          and doubling the second root letter. It often has a reflexive or
          intensive meaning. For example, it can mean to do something to oneself
          or to do something intensely.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>تعلّم (ta'allama)</strong> - He learned. The root letters
            ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) mean to know, and adding a ta and doubling the second
            letter changes the meaning to learning, i.e., acquiring knowledge
            for oneself.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>تكلّم (takallama)</strong> - He spoke. The root letters
            ك-ل-م (k-l-m) mean to speak, and adding a ta and doubling the second
            letter changes the meaning to speaking, often implying that the
            subject is speaking for themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form VI (الفعل السداسي)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding a ta (ت) before the first root letter
          and an alif (ا) between the first and second root letters. It often
          has a reciprocal meaning, indicating an action done mutually or
          together.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>تشارك (tashara)</strong> - He participated. The root letters
            ش-ر-ك (sh-r-k) mean to share, and adding a ta and an alif conveys
            the meaning of participating or sharing with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>تكاتب (takataba)</strong> - He corresponded. The root
            letters ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) mean to write, and adding a ta and an alif
            changes the meaning to writing to each other, i.e., corresponding.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form VII (الفعل المضعف)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding a ta (ت) before the first root letter
          and doubling the second root letter. It often has a passive meaning,
          indicating that the subject is receiving the action.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>انكسر (inkasara)</strong> - It was broken. The root letters
            ك-س-ر (k-s-r) mean to break, and adding a ta and doubling the second
            letter changes the meaning to being broken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>انقطع (inqata'a)</strong> - It was cut. The root letters
            ق-ط-ع (q-t-ʿ) mean to cut, and adding a ta and doubling the second
            letter changes the meaning to being cut.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form VIII (الفعل المزيد فيه تاء)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding a ta (ت) after the first root letter.
          It often has a reflexive meaning, indicating that the subject is
          performing the action on themselves.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>اجتمع (ijtama'a)</strong> - He gathered. The root letters
            ج-م-ع (j-m-'a) mean to gather, and adding a ta changes the meaning
            to gathering oneself or coming together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>اشتعل (ishtala)</strong> - It ignited. The root letters
            ش-ع-ل (sh-ʿ-l) mean to light or ignite, and adding a ta changes the
            meaning to igniting oneself or catching fire.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form IX (الفعل المزيد فيه تاء)</h2>
        <p>
          This form is created by adding an alif (ا) between the first and
          second root letters and a shadda ( ّ) on the second root letter. It
          often indicates becoming or acquiring a color or defect.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>احمرّ (ihmara)</strong> - He became red. The root letters
            ح-م-ر (ḥ-m-r) mean red, and adding an alif and a shadda changes the
            meaning to becoming red.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>اصفرّ (isfara)</strong> - He became yellow. The root letters
            ص-ف-ر (ṣ-f-r) mean yellow, and adding an alif and a shadda changes
            the meaning to becoming yellow.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form X (الفعل المزيد فيه تاء)</h2>

          This form is created by adding an alif (ا) before the first root
          letter and a ta (ت) after the first root letter. It often indicates
          seeking or asking for something.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            root letters غ-ف-ر (gh-f-r) mean to forgive, and adding an alif and
            a ta changes the meaning to seeking forgiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
