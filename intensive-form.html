        <h2>Introduction to the Intensive Form</h2>
        <p>
          The Intensive Form in Arabic (المبالغة) is used to express a high
          degree of an action or a quality. It often indicates that someone is
          an expert or exhibits a particular characteristic to an extreme level.
        </p>
        <p>
          This form is typically derived from the root of a verb and follows
          specific patterns, mainly based on the verb's form.
        </p>

        <h2>Formation of the Intensive Form</h2>
        <p>
          The Intensive Form is primarily formed from Form I verbs, and it can
          be constructed by following these common patterns:
        </p>

        <h3>Form I (فعل ثلاثي مجرد)</h3>
        <p>
          For Form I verbs, the Intensive Form is usually formed by repeating
          the second root letter and adding a vowel at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>كتّاب (kattab)</strong> - writer (from كتب - kataba, meaning
            "to write").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>مُدرّس (mudarris)</strong> - teacher (from درس - darasa,
            meaning "to study").
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Form II (فعل ثلاثي مزيد بحرف)</h3>
        <p>
          The Intensive Form can also be derived from Form II verbs, typically
          by altering the structure slightly.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>مُعَلّم (mu'allim)</strong> - teacher (from درّس - darrasa,
            meaning "to teach").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>مُصمّم (musammim)</strong> - designer (from صمّم - sammama,
            meaning "to design").
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Form III (فعل ثلاثي مزيد بحرف)</h3>
        <p>
          The Intensive Form for Form III verbs may follow a similar pattern as
          well.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>مُشارك (musharik)</strong> - participant (from شارك -
            sharika, meaning "to participate").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>مُستشار (mustashar)</strong> - consultant (from استشار -
            ishtashara, meaning "to consult").
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uses of the Intensive Form</h2>
        <p>The Intensive Form is used in various contexts, such as:</p>
        <ul>
